# zshenv.d - Modular Environment Configuration

This directory contains modular zsh environment configurations that are
sourced by ~/.config/zsh/.zshenv.

Files in this directory should:
- End with .zsh extension
- Be focused on environment variables (not interactive shell features)
- Be self-contained and not depend on load order

This pattern allows Eden branches to add their own environment settings
without modifying the base .zshenv file.
