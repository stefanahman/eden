# Eden Graft Allowlist
#
# List paths (relative to branch root) that should be symlinked to $HOME.
# One path per line. Comments and blank lines are ignored.
#
# This file controls what configs from this branch get grafted by `eden graft`.
#
# Paths auto-handled by dedicated grafters (do NOT list here).
# Each grafter declares what it covers via `graft-<name> --covers`.
# `eden doctor` uses this to detect ungrafted configs automatically.
#
# Everything else needs to be listed below to be deployed.
