# Eden Branches Configuration
# Copy this to ~/.config/eden/branches and customize
# List one branch repository path per line

# Example branches (uncomment and edit paths):
# /home/stefan/Development/eden-branches/work-repo
# /home/stefan/Development/eden-branches/personal-repo
# /home/stefan/Development/eden-branches/client-acme-repo

# Each branch repo will be stowed independently when Eden deploys
# Order matters: later branches can override earlier ones
